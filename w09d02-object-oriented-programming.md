# Object Oriented Programming

## Opening

In most object-oriented languages, including Ruby, every object is an **example** or **instance** of a particular class.

Every object can do different things. A human can walk and talk, a bird can fly and a pen can write.

#### Why do we create objects?

We use objects in coding to represent objects in the real world. When 'modelling' objects, we try to define their characteristics and things that they can do.

We often create programmable objects in order to model the behaviour of real-world objects, like **Users** and **Invoices**. However, they can also be objects that are not physical, like **Time** or **Friendships**.

#### What is the difference between an object and a class?

We use classes to define our objects. They are just a piece of code that wraps around more code that defines our object.

#### Data types

We have looked at some data types and some of the things they can do.

#### Assess: Can you name them?

- Integers
- Floats
- Strings
- Booleans
- Arrays
- Hashes
- Symbols

Let's remind ourselves and have a look at an example of a `String`.

``` sh
$ irb
```

``` ruby
"".class
=> String
```

But what is a `String`? A string is an `Object`... this empty string is actually an **instance** of a `String` class.

Let's have a look at something called the classtree in Ruby:

#### Class Tree

![ruby_classtree](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40461/10583597/b89e14fc-7685-11e5-8afb-8a73fcd3fa1b.jpg)

It's not actually 100% complete but it's close.

## I Do: Inheritance

We can see the relationship between a `String` and an `Object` by doing:

``` ruby
"".class.superclass
=> Object
```

And what is an Object's superclass?

``` ruby
"".class.superclass.superclass
=> BasicObject
```

How can something be both a `String` and an `Object` and an example of a `BasicObject`? The answer is inheritance.

Inheritance is a kind-of downward-chaining relationship between two classes (the `superclass` and the `subclass`), whereby one class "inherits" from another.

All the instances of the `subclass` acquire the methods defined in the `superclass`.

Let's think of it in terms of a Human.

#### Draw on board

```
Human < Mammal < Animal
```

However inheritance, when trying to model real world objects, can get tricky because you could also write:

```
Human < Homosapien
```

It's up to you to decide how you define your classes in Ruby.

#### Classical Inheritance

We call this type of inheritance 'classical' inheritance.

<br>

## We Do: Creating basic Objects

From the classtree, you can see that every Object can do certain things in Ruby: these are the _methods_ that are defined in the `Object` class.

#### Instantiation

Let's create a new Object using Ruby:

``` ruby
object = Object.new
=> #<Object:0x007f97691f80a8>
```

This `.new` syntax creates a new version of that object. We call that **instantiation**.

We can check what methods every object can do by doing

``` ruby
object.methods
=> [:nil?, :===, :=~, :!~, :eql?, :hash, :<=>, :class, :singleton_class, :clone, :dup, :taint, :tainted?, :untaint, :untrust, :untrusted?, :trust, :freeze, :frozen?, :to_s, :inspect, :methods, :singleton_methods, :protected_methods, :private_methods, :public_methods, :instance_variables, :instance_variable_get, :instance_variable_set, :instance_variable_defined?, :remove_instance_variable, :instance_of?, :kind_of?, :is_a?, :tap, :send, :public_send, :respond_to?, :extend, :display, :method, :public_method, :singleton_method, :define_singleton_method, :object_id, :to_enum, :enum_for, :==, :equal?, :!, :!=, :instance_eval, :instance_exec, :__send__, :__id__]
```

We say that this object is an _instance_ of the `Object` Class.

<br>

## I Do: Class is a template

A class is like a cookie cutter for an object. It defines how each new Object will be made and what properties it will have.

![class_cookie_cutter](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40461/10583603/c20ebea6-7685-11e5-9fe6-1d1ede485900.jpeg)

When you instantiate a new instance of an object, it is like cutting out a new cookie.

If you eat a cookie, you are eating one instance of a cookie. All the other cookies that you have cut out remain intact.

#### Fist of 5

This is a really important concept, so please ask question if you don't understand that analogy.

<br>

## We Do: Instance vs class methods

#### Choose a person in the class

To chosen person:

> <cite>"You are an instance of a `Person` class. Many of the basic things you can do, everyone else can do because they are also instances of a `Person` class."<cite>

> <cite>"Can you please raise your hand?

Chosen person raises their hand.

> <cite>"Other instances of the `Person` class haven't been asked to do anything because I've sent you an **instance method**."

> <cite>"However, if I asked every `Person` to raise their hand... Class, please raise your hands..."

Everyone raises their hands.

> <cite>"This is an example of a **class method**."

Actually, if we were being exact - all people would have to raise their hands.

<br>

## We Do: Defining an object using a class

Let's create a new file:

``` sh
$ touch person.rb
```

To define a class, we use the keyword `class` followed by the class name (eg `Person` &ndash; class names that contain more than one word are written using the CamelCase convention). We will close a class with an `end`, at the end of the file.

``` ruby
class Person
  def talk(words)
    puts "I say, #{words}"
  end
end

bob = Person.new
puts bob.class
```

#### Using an instance method

We can call the `.talk()` method which we defined in the `Person` class. This is an instance method. We are calling it on the instance:

``` ruby
class Person
  def talk(words)
    puts "I say, #{words}"
  end
end

bob = Person.new
# puts bob.class

bob.talk "hello"
```

<br>

## Closure

We're going to be playing a bit more with defining custom classes and making methods. This is a really core concept in Ruby and it's important that everyone understands this.
