## Angular App with ngResource

The starter code provided includes just the API. We want you to build out the whole of the Angular app, incorporate ngResource and create a factory so that you can use it throughout your controllers.

### Required
- A fully RESTful app with CRUD actions on our model of birds.
- Set up your front end routes with the respective controller, one at a time, and test them to ensure they're fully functional.
- Make a factory for our birds.
- Add a custom directive for an individual bird on both the show page & the index page.
	
	
###Â Tips
- Read the lesson notes.
- Where's your ng-app? Is it in the `<head>` instead of the `<html>` where it should be?
- Double check your `templateUrl` paths.
- Ensure you install the correct dependencies:
	- `angular-ui-router`
	- `angular-resource`
- Don't forget to inject your factory into each of your controllers.
